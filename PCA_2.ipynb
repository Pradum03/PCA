    "In linear algebra, a projection is a linear transformation that projects a vector onto a subspace. In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), projection is used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, while preserving as much of the original data variation as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection involves finding a set of principal components (PCs), which are linear combinations of the original features, that captures the maximum amount of variation in the data. The first principal component captures the largest amount of variation in the data, followed by the second principal component, and so on. The projection then involves projecting the data points onto the lower-dimensional space spanned by these PCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting projected data has a reduced dimensionality but retains the maximum amount of information about the original data. This is because the PCs are chosen in such a way that they capture the directions of maximum variation in the data, and so projecting the data onto these directions preserves as much of the variation as possible."
